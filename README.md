The program of our code is about a travel-manager .
The code that we built offers these options :
-Add a flight 
-Show the description of a flight 
-Delete a flight 
-Modify a flight 
-Search for the amout of flights available for the user according to the dates indicated by the user 
-Quit the program

In conclusion, the user is going to enter the program to search for a flight according to his input . And all the the program will be run by the main code
for example if the user want to add a flight the program will run the "voyage.c" file . If he choose the third option the program will delete a flight based on
the user's modification and input .

Finally the program closes all the files after the use  .
